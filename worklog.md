Keeping track of the work done each week.

## 1/27

This week was spent putting together a sound library to use as a starting point for the composition. Some of the library was recently recorded (candle jar, ice, gingersnap box, etc.), and the rest of the library was from the recordings I took for Music 409 about a year ago. This sound library is by no means complete, and if I encounter any sonically interesting objects I'll be sure to record them and add them in as well. I may also continue to scour my 409 library as there are a lot of files in there that may come of use.

One other thing of note- I was using Audacity to record the sounds and it turns out I made an error with some of my recordings. When I was exporting the chopped up audio I was mistakenly using "Export as WAV" rather than "Export Selected Audio," which causes some of the recordings I did to hold the entire track rather than the portion cut down to the sample itself. Objects affected by this include: candle jar, cardboard tube, gingersnap box, ice, salt shaker, yeti bottle, and rubber band. I'll spend some time the following week cutting these samples back down to what I had originally intended.
