# Worklog

Keeping track of the work done each week.

## 1/27

This week was spent putting together a sound library to use as a starting point for the composition. Some of the library was recently recorded (candle jar, ice, gingersnap box, etc.), and the rest of the library was from the recordings I took for Music 409 about a year ago. This sound library is by no means complete, and if I encounter any sonically interesting objects I'll be sure to record them and add them in as well. I may also continue to scour my 409 library as there are a lot of files in there that may come of use.
